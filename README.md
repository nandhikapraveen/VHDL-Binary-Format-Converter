# VHDL-Binary-Format-Converter

## Overview

The Binary Format Converter project is designed to facilitate quick and accurate conversion of binary numbers into various formats including Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), Graycode, Hexadecimal, Octal, and Excess-3. The project utilizes VHDL for implementation on an FPGA platform.

### Features

- Conversion of binary numbers to:
  - BCD
  - Graycode
  - Hexadecimal
  - Octal
  - Excess-3
- Single testbench code applicable to multiple conversions

## Motivation

Binary representation is not human-readable and often requires manual conversion for interpretation. This project aims to automate the conversion process, making data transition between systems and users efficient and error-free.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Requirements:** FPGA platform capable of running VHDL code.
2. **Setup:** Clone the repository and configure the FPGA with the provided VHDL files.
3. **Execution:** Follow FPGA-specific instructions for compiling and running the code.
